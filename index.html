          <h2>What is Sa3edni?</h2>
          <p>
            Sa3edni is a mental-health platform concept designed in Lebanon by business students at the Lebanese
            American University (LAU). Our goal is to make psychological support more accessible, affordable, and
            culturally relevant for students, staff, and the wider community.
          </p>
          <p>
            We aim to reduce barriers such as stigma, cost, and lack of information by providing a secure digital space
            where users can reach out for support whenever they need it.
